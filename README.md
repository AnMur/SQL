# SQL  


This is my project analyzing the 2018 Olympic Figure Skating Scores with the Structured Query Language. 
You might click on a Olympic.sql file to open the query.

All work was performed in the Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio and uploaded to github.
I also added comments to my codes on what I did.
Alghough it is impossible for you to check if this code works, it was tested on my side 
and I was able to retrieve all needed information.

Also, I wanted to share a link to my Tableau portfolio with my last visualizations:
